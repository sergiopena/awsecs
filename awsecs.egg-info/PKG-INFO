        ## Prereqs
        Setup your profiles using the aws cli
        
        ```sh
        aws configure --profile PROFILE_NAME
        ```
        
        You can also leave out the `--profile PROFILE_NAME` param to set your `default` credentials

        This code now has an external dependency on fzf please install it using your preferred package manager.
        
        ## Setup
        
        ### pip
        ```
        pip install awscon
        ```
        ### source
         ```
         git clone git@github.com:sergiopena/awscon.git
         cd awscon
         python setup.py install
         ```
        
        ## Tests
        No test at the moment... SHAME!
        
        ## How to use?
        * An exported env var named AWS_PROFILE is required, as this is the profile that will be used to retrieve running ec2 instances
        * Profile must include the region, currently we only support one region.
        * Run `awscon` it will retrieve your EC2 running instances and display a menu to connect to them.
